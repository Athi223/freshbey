## Project Purpose!

I am a huge enthusiast of open source. Contributing to open source is a fantastic way to learn and grow. Making open source contributions will require you to have been exposed to a few important concepts, practices, and transferable skills:

- Version control
- Working with tickets & issues
- Working with other developers
- Creating pull requests
- Experiencing a code review process
- Setting up a local development environment
- Contributing code to a pre-existing codebase

## General Idea

Freshbey is an e-commerce platform where users can order grocery items. I built this project originally for a client but they did not pay the agreed amount. After that, I made this project open source.

## Current State

As of now, Freshbey is built using MERN stack. Additionally, [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) along with [Bootswatch Zephyr](https://bootswatch.com/zephyr/) theme is used for styling and [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) is used for state management.

## Getting Started

### Setting up the repository

Fork the repository at - [roopeshsn/freshbey](https://github.com/roopeshsn/freshbey) to your GitHub account.

Then clone the forked repository, by typing the following line in your local terminal/powershell. Remember to replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/freshbey.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository on your local system

```bash
cd freshbey
```

Add remotes to the parent repository. This will help you fetch the code from the
parent repo to avoid any merge conflicts later.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/roopeshsn/freshbey.git
```

To verify, use the command `git remote -v` to check if you have two remotes - origin and upstream set up.

Finally, fetch the upstream's latest code from the main branch.

```bash
git fetch upstream master
```

### Env Variables

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```
NODE_ENV = production
PORT = 5000
MONGODB_URI = 
JWT_SECRET = 
EMAIL_USERNAME = 
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 
EMAIL_HOST = 
EMAIL_PORT =
```

###  Add data in .env file

#### MONGODB_URI

For getting URI go to [MongoDB Site](www.mongodb.com) and make a account there and you will get a uri like this
`
 mongodb+srv://admin=(ADMIN_INFO_TO_BE_INSERTED).mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majoritymyFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
`

#### JWT_SECRET

Add any string like YOUR_NAME_ANY_SIGN (eg-chrismathew@123) is used to create a private key which will authenticate 

#### EMAIL_USERNAME, EMAIL_PASSWORD, EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT

To get this crendentails go to [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io) and there sign up for free and you will get all this crendentails there and choose nodemailer in dropdown section there like below

##### You will get info like this
```
var transport = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.mailtrap.io",
  port: 2525,
  auth: {
    user: "99195eec06f5",
    pass: "d26fe4c7d762"
  }
});
```
